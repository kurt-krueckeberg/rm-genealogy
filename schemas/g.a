=== Gramps Sqlite3 DB

The Gramps Sqlite3 database has a lot of doumentation:


This link explains how the SQL database is a sort of port of the prior Berkley Database, *key/value* database store:

Gramps previously used a hierarchical (nota relational) data model that was stored in a BSDDB. In Gramps 5.1 the default backend is Sqlite, but a relational model is not used. Instead Gramps uses "SQL"

____
in exactly the same way that we used *BSDDB*: all of our data is pickled "blobs" (serialized tuples). However, the
flat (non-hierarchical) data is also stored in their own column, and indexes are made on each of those. This allows us to have very
fast ad hoc queries on any non-hierarchical data, and JOINS between primary objects. As far as I know, we always did sequential scans
in BSDDB. If we connect the SQL WHERE capability up to Filters, then our filters will not require a linear scan through all data. 
This will be a huge win, but requires a some serious refactoring of views, filters, and the use of the database.


...All of the SQL statements are in a single file https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps/blob/master/gramps/plugins/db/dbapi/dbapi.py*gramps/plugins/database/dbapi.py[dbapi.py].
All the SQL statements used in Gramps are stored in the file
