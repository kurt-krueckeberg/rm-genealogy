When there is more than one name in the NameTable, the BirthYear and DeathYear attributes are always the same. Even if a person has several names (say, several different given name variations), the BirthYear and DeathYear
are identical for every name.

And the rows selected by the query

[source, sql]
----
SELECT OwnerID, count(*) as total_names from NameTable group by OwnerID having total_names > 1 order by OwnerID;
----

are the same as when you `group by OwnerID, BirthYear, DeathYear`:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT OwnerID, BirthYear,DeathYear, count(*) as tuple_total from NameTable group by OwnerID, BirthYear, DeathYear having tuple_total > 1
----

So joining these queries and selecting results from the join where total_names != tuple_total never returns anything:

[source, sql]
----
select r1.OwnerID, total_names, r2.BirthYear, r2.DeathYear, tuple_total
 from 
 (SELECT OwnerID, count(*) as total_names from NameTable group by OwnerID having total_names > 1) as r1
    join
 (SELECT OwnerID, BirthYear,DeathYear, count(*) as tuple_total from NameTable group by OwnerID, BirthYear, DeathYear having tuple_total > 1) as r2
    on r1.OwnerID=r2.OwnerID
 WHERE total_names!=tuple_total;
----
