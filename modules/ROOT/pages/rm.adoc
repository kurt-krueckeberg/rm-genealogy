= Roots Magic Database

Roots Magic uses a SQLite database with acustom collation sequence `RMNOCASE`, which prevents the SQL `order by` clause from working. The workaround
is to add `lower(column-name)` for those columns mentioned in the `order by`, so the string comparisions will be done on lowercase'ed strings.

The following pages explain aspects of the Roots Magic database tables. Much of this
information came from https://sqlitetoolsforrootsmagic.com/[SQLite Tools for Roots Magic].
