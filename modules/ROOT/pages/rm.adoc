= Roots Magic Database

Roots Magic has always used and still uses a SQLite database. It uses custom RootsMagic collation sequence
`RMNOCASE` that  prevents `order by` from working in SQL statements. As a workaround, use `lower(column-name)` for
in `order by` clauses or for string comparisons.

The following pages explain aspects of the Roots Magic database tables. Much of this
information came from https://sqlitetoolsforrootsmagic.com/[SQLite Tools for Roots Magic].
