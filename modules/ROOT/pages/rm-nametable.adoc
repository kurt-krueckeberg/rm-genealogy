= Name table Explained

When a unique person in the Roots Magic database more than one associated name, the `NameTable.OwnerID` occurs more than once in `NameTable`. The `BirthYear` and
`DeathYear` attributes, however, are always the same.

To reach this conclusion, these queries were done. First, if you count the number rows selected by the query

[source, sql]
----
SELECT OwnerID, count(*) as total_names
from NameTable
group by OwnerID having total_names > 1
order by OwnerID;
----

they are the same as when you attempt to further refine the grouping: `group by OwnerID, BirthYear, DeathYear`

[source, sql]
----
SELECT OwnerID, BirthYear,DeathYear, count(*) as tuple_total
from NameTable
group by OwnerID, BirthYear, DeathYear
having tuple_total > 1
----

Thus, joining these queries and selecting results and joining them  `where total_names != tuple_total` never returns anything:

[source, sql]
----
select r1.OwnerID, total_names, r2.BirthYear, r2.DeathYear, tuple_total
  from 
  (SELECT OwnerID, count(*) as total_names
   from NameTable
   group by OwnerID
     having total_names > 1) as r1
 join
   (SELECT OwnerID, BirthYear,DeathYear, count(*) as tuple_total
    from NameTable
    group by OwnerID, BirthYear, DeathYear
    having tuple_total > 1) as r2
 on r1.OwnerID=r2.OwnerID
 WHERE total_names!=tuple_total;
----
