= Overview

There are only about 6 or 7 files with FactTypes < 1000; i.e., not user-defined events. Of thesee, something like three are marriages 
and two or three are military service.

NOTE: all-jpgs.txt has the counts for all the uniquely named `.jpg` files in `~/d/genealogy` and its subfolders. There are not duplicates.
But some files may be the same as on Ancestry. I will only learn this empirically by checking.

Roots Magic sychronization with Ancestry.com downloaded 1057 files--jpg, png, docx, pdf, etc--to `~/d/genealogy/roots-magic-09-06-2023_media/`.

`media.sql`, from <https://sqlitetoolsforrootsmagic.com/>, lists where media items are used and their key properties. 

In the query results, some of file names, `MediaFile`, occur more than once. This is because there are four possible `OwnerTypeDesc` values:

1. Alt. Name
2. Citation
3. Event
4. Person

They occur with this frequency:

Occurances of `OnwerTypeDesc`:

## Analysis of OwnerTypeDesc and OwnerName

The `OwnerName` differs depending on the `OwnerTypeDesc`. The format of `OwnerName`, of the person's name, when `OwnerTypeDesc = Person`
or `OwerTypeDesc = Alt. Name` is:

----
OwnerName = RIEHL, Anna E-3132
----

The format is:

1. First, the surname all in caps
2. followed by a comma
3. followed by the given names
4. followed by a '-' and then the `OwnerID` (which I assume is the `PersonID`)

When `OwnerTypeDesc` is `Event` or `Citation`, the `OwnerName` has an additional suffix information introduced with `:`.
The `OwnerName` suffix for `OwnerTypeDesc = Event` is a subset of at least one of the `OwerTypeDesc = Citation` as shown below:

`Event` suffix information examples:

----
OwnerTypeDesc = Event
OwnerName = WEBER, Emilie F-3176:  AUGUST W. BUSSE

OwnerTypeDesc = Event
OwnerName = WEBER, Emilie F-3176:  AUGUST W. BUSSE
----

Question: For every `OwnerTypeDesc = Event` is there also a `OwerTypeDesc = Citation` entry?
A: Who knows. Likely, yes. The thing I really want is the EventType/FactTypeID for each

== Plan

For those media files that have an associated Event, I need the FactType's string representation. See what the Roots Magic shows as the event and
if it includes a thumnail of or the actual Ancestry.com image (or docx, pdf, etc).
