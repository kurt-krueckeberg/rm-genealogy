== RootsMagic Sqlite3 DB
RootsMagic 8 (RM8) is a Sqlite3 database that uses a custom collation scheme RMNOCASE that often prevents `Order By` from working.

== SQLite3 Tools

In addition to the Ubuntu command line *Sqlite3* package, https://sqlitetoolsforrootsmagic.com[SQLite Tools] lists other Sqlite3 tools.

== Todo

Does creating and index `Create Index ...` on a table column imply that it is `UNIQUE`? If so, I need to note this.
