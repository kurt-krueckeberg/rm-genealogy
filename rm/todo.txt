For OwnerName:

1. Change the uppercase of surnames to lowercase - except first letter.
2. Remove the dash and what follows from the OwnerName

Some/many files change are references by several people and by more than one type of owner, as follows: 


Occurances | Type of owner
     16 OwnerTypeDesc = Alternate Name
   9714 OwnerTypeDesc = Citation
    330 OwnerTypeDesc = Event
    896 OwnerTypeDesc = Person

Is a person always referenced when an event or citation is?
